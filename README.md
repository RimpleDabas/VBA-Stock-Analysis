The  script  loops  through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

 The  conditional formatting  highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.


It further includes functionality which returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

The output images from the three years are attatched in the repositry.

The .vbs script with the code is also included. You can drag and drop it as a module in VBA to run it.
